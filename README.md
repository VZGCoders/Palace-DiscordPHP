**This fork is dedicated to maintaining the code used by Palace Bot#9203, which runs on the teamreflex/DiscordPHP API library. You can choose to self-host your own instance of this bot or invite my hosted instance to your server. If hosting your own instance, it is advisable to merge all -include.php files into run.php to remove the read overhead of loading a file every time it is needed. Please note that doing so will require the bot to be restarted any time a change is made to it.**

# Before you start
Before you start using this Library, you **need** to know how DiscordPHP works, how PHP works, and how ReactPHP Event Loops and Promises work. This is a fundamental requirement before you start. Without this knowledge, you will only suffer.

See https://github.com/elazar/asynchronous-php for resources.
